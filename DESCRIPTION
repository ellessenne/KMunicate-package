Description: Produce Kaplan–Meier plots in the style recommended following the KMunicate 
  study by Morris et al. (2019) <doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030215>. The KMunicate style
  consists of Kaplan-Meier curves with confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty and
  an extended risk table (per treatment arm) depicting the number of study subjects at 
  risk, events, and censored observations over time. The resulting plots are built using
  'ggplot2' and can be further customised to a certain extent, including themes, fonts, and 
  colour scales.
