# KMunicate (development version)

### New features

* New argument `.title` to add a title to the plot;
* Some small updates to documentation.

# KMunicate 0.2.2

This is a minor release, with the following changes:

* Updated maintainer e-mail.
* Fixed URL that was moved.

# KMunicate 0.2.1

This is a minor release.
The only change is in the vignette, which has been updated by removing examples of custom fonts to avoid issues (and headaches) on CRAN and other testing environments (e.g. GitHub Actions).
This fully removes the dependency (as a suggested package) to {extrafont}.

* New argument `.legend.position` to customise the location of the plot legend.
