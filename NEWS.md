# KMunicate (development version)

# KMunicate 0.2.2

* Updated maintainer e-mail.
* Fixed URL that was moved.

# KMunicate 0.2.1

This is a minor release.
The only change is in the vignette, which has been updated by removing examples of custom fonts to avoid issues (and headaches) on CRAN and other testing environments (e.g. GitHub Actions).
This fully removes the dependency (as a suggested package) to {extrafont}.

### New features

* New argument `.linetype_scale` to customise the linetype scale of the plot;
* New argument `.annotate` to add custom annotations (and other stuff, in principle) to the plot;
* New argument `.size` to customise the thickness (e.g. `size` argument, in `ggplot2` terms) of each Kaplan-Meier curve;
* New argument `.legend.position` to customise the location of the plot legend. 

# KMunicate 0.1.0

### New features

* New argument `.ylab` to customise the label for the vertical axis;
* New argument `.risk_table_base_size` to customise the base font size for the risk table;
* Small edits to default plot style.
